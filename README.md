# Obsidian Nomad Website Repository

This repository includes website information and file data for the [Obsidian Nomad](https://obsidian-nomad.netlify.app) website.

The website itself is currently hosted via Netlify (which deploys the website alongside GitHub) and its domain provided by Google Domains (currently not active).
The DNS settings have been changed to work with Netlify (instead of Google Domains' interface) and its various features to provide the best experience for management.

There is an MIT license included with this version of the project, which may be subject to change at any time, or with any new version/changes.
You are highly encouraged to read it. This project was publicly accessible from August 30, 2020 to November 20, 2020. It is now a private repository (and may be subject to change).
