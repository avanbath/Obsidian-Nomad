# Obsidian Nomad Website Repository

This is my official website repository.
This repository includes website information and file data for the Obsidian Nomad website (directed to www.obsidian-nomad.ca).

The website itself is hosted via Netlify (which deploys the website alongside GitHub) and its domain name is provided by Google Domains.
The DNS settings have been changed to work with Netlify (instead of Google Domains' interface) and its various features to provide the best experience for management.

There is an MIT license included with this version of the project, which may be subject to change at any time, or with any new version/changes.
You are highly encouraged to read it. I have made this project publicly accessible, as of August 30, 2020 (this may also be subject to change; it may switch to a private repository in the future).

Feel free to contact me through GitHub, have you any questions or concerns. Oppurtunities to work with others may also be considered. I'm always open to discussion and improvements!
